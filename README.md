## A simple OpenGL application, producing user generated 3D graphics.

The focus of this project is to obtain experience in the following:
* Fammiliarize myself with using CMake for project handling.
* Fammiliarize myself with Linux development. 
* Implement graphics manipulaiton through matrix calculations (Translation, Scaling, Rotation) in 3D Space.

The application uses Arthur Sonzogni OpenGL CMake Skeleton application. Introducing CMake with adding external dependencies was quite frustrating, and thus decided on a skeleton project.
